# SeriesMaster App

This is the final project for the 3 months Web Dev Bootcamp at neue Fische.

I built an App to create a list of already watched TV shows. The user can put a show on 
their watch- or completed list. The user will also be informed with a push notification when a new episode 
of one of their shows on their list comes out.

I am building this App with Expo in React Native. This is the link for the Expo deployment.
